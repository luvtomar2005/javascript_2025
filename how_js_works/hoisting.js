// //? Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where 
// variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their 
// scope before code execution. This means that no matter where functions
//  and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope 
// regardless of whether their scope is global or local.

// //todo When a function declaration is hoisted,
//  its entire definition (including the body) is moved to
//  the top of its containing scope during the creation phase. 
// This means that you can call the function before it's actually declared 
// in the code, and it will still work as expected.


let myVar = 10;
const greet = () => {
    console.log("Welcome , IF your are reading that means Luv is great He is a legend.. He is genius");
